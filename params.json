{"name":"Usbkbd2","body":"This is a simple hack to redirect keystrokes from Linux's /dev/ files to the ALSA midi system.  This means you can plus lots of old PC keyboards into your machine and have them send out midi notes instead of letters and numbers.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways to convert your keyboard to midi that use the currently attached keyboards but clearly you want one for writing.  With this little hack you can attach multiple midi keyboards that are always a midi keyboards and you dont loose your main keyboard's functionality.\r\n\r\nIts Linux only and requires running some commands and fiddling around with X configs, but it works for me.  I have a 17 key numberpad acting as a drum kit and different keyboard for synth stabs, plus a real midi keyboard and a keyboard for writing.   \r\n\r\nI love Linux, its sooo hackable.","tagline":"Converts old USB keyboards into midi keyboards","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
